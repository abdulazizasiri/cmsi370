\noindent This investigation aimed to record some usability metrics for two mobile map applications as well as explore \textit{why} these applications performed the way that they did. The two map applications examined were Google Maps \cite{Pan} and Apple Maps \footnote[2]{https://www.apple.com/ios/maps}. Users that took part in this study were given iPhone devices and told to execute three concrete tasks with each application; measurements were taken throughout the execution. Usability metrics were then used in order to make a judgment call on which map application performed best.

\section{Introduction}

When Apple Maps was first released as part of iOS6 in September 2012, they received a signifcant amount of negative feedback. The Google Maps mobile apps, on both iOS and Android, were used by roughly 81 million people in September 2012. However, Apple Maps slowly began gaining traction and by September 2013, the numer of users of Google Maps dropped to around 58.7 million. Interaction design is a field of study that has grown and matured a considerable amount in recent years. The current consensus of the field measures the performance of systems based on five distinct metrics: \textit{learnability}, \textit{efficiency}, \textit{errors}, \textit{memorability}, and \textit{satisfaction}.\cite{Nielsen}
\section{The Model} \label{sec:Model}

Model for testing users. 


\subsection{How to Include Figures}

First you have to upload the image file (JPEG, PNG or PDF) from your computer to writeLaTeX using the upload link the project menu. Then use the includegraphics command to include it in your document. Use the figure environment and the caption command to add a number and a caption to your figure. See the code for Figure \ref{fig:frog} in this section for an example.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{frog.jpg}
\caption{\label{fig:frog}This frog was uploaded to writeLaTeX via the project menu.}
\end{figure}
